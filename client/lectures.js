Is the employment condition of the country as a whole, or of some sectors of the economy, getting better or is it worsening? What would be reasonable indicators to show that the economy is better or worse? What steps, if any, can the State take, or the people ask for, in order to improve the state of the economy?\nIf output of food grain is experiencing a growth, it is generally accompanied by a rise in the output level of industrial goods\nIf aggregate output level, price level, or employment level, in the different production units of an economy bear close relationship to each other then the task of analysing entire economy becomes relatively easy.\nInstead of dealing with the above mentioned variables at individual (disaggregated) levels, we can think of a single good as the representative of all the goods and services produced within the economy.

Production is carried out by producers or firms. A firm acquires different inputs like labor, machines, land, raw materials etc. It uses these inputs to produce output.\nProduction is instantaneous: in our very simple model of production, no time elapses between the combination of the inputs and the production of the output.\nPrice for input = Cost of production\nInputs of firm = production faactors\nOutput sold in market = revenue\nProfit = revenue – cost (aim is maximize profit)\n\nProduction Function\nProduction function of a firm is a relationship between inputs used and output produced by the firm. For various quantities of inputs used, it gives the maximum quantity of output that can be produced.\nExample, to produce (q) wheat – requires land (hectares as K) and labor (hours of work done as L)\n\n\nMore interesting topics subscribe at TestPrep: https://www.youtube.com/c/TestPrep\n\nNCERT, Yojana, Kurukshetra, Down to Earth, Science, Social Studies and More interesting topics subscribe at ExamraceHindi: https://www.youtube.com/c/ExamraceHindi\n\nFor kids videos subscribe to FunProf: https://www.youtube.com/c/FunProf\n\nFor Science Class 11-12 and important topics subscribe to DoorStepTutor: https://www.youtube.com/c/DoorstepTutor\n\nBehavior of Consumer @0:15\nProduction @2:12\nPrice of Input @4:58\nInputs of Firm @5:09\nOutput Sold in Market @5:19\nMaximization of Profit @6:26\nTypes of Production @6:46\nProduction Function @7:45\nIsoquants @10:31\nMarginal Utility @12:36\nProduction Function @16:15\nVariable Cost @16:53\nFixed Factor @17:04\nShort Term Production Function @17:26\nTotal Production, Average Production & Marginal Production @18:22\nLaw of Diminishing Marginal Productivity @21:11\nReturns to Scale @24:18\nCobb-Douglas Production Function @25:59\nAssumption of Returns to Scale @27:11\nCost @27:44\nLong Run Costs & Short Run Costs @28:26\nShort Run Marginal Cost @30:18\nShort Run Cost @30:47\nLong Run Costs @33:41\n#Proportions #Diminishing #Decreasing  #Isoquants #Technical #Substitution #Function #Revenue #Production #Consumer #Manishika #Examrace #examrace #upsc #ugcnet",

Since price remains the same for any level of output of the individual firm, such a firm is able to sell any quantity that it wishes to sell at the given market price. It, therefore, does not need to compete with other firms to obtain a market for its produce. This is clearly the opposite of the meaning of what is commonly\nunderstood by competition or competitive behaviour. \nCoke and Pepsi compete with each other in a variety of ways to achieve a higher level of sales or a greater share of the market. Conversely, we do not find individual farmers competing among themselves to sell a larger amount of crop. This is because both Coke and Pepsi possess the power to influence the market\nprice of soft drinks, while the individual farmer does not. Thus, competitive behaviour and competitive market structure are, in general, inversely related; the more competitive the market structure, less competitive is the behaviour of the firms\n\nMonopoly problems\nSubstitutes will come – cannot exist \npure monopoly situation is never without competition. This is because the economy is never stationary – new technologies will come \nSince monopoly firms earn large profits, they possess sufficient funds to take up research and development work, something which the small perfectly competitive firm is unable to do.\nMonopolies make supernormal profits, they may benefit consumers by lowering costs\n\nChapters:\n0:00 NCERT Class 12 Microeconomics Chapter 6: Non-Competitive Markets\n0:15 Monopoly\n1:14 Market Structure\n 9:20 Relation Between Price and Quantity\n11:24 Total, Marginal and Average Revenue\n18:25 Elasticity of Demand\n22:55 Price Elasticity\n26:20 Perfect Competition\n26:54 Perfectly Competitive Market\n27:20 Long Run Equilibrium of Monopoly Firm\n32:30 Problems of Monopoly\n35:36 Monopolies Development\n37:35 Monopolistic Competition\n46:02 Oligopoly\n#microeconomics #noncompetitivemarkets #monopoly #marketstructure #relationbetweenpriceandquantity #totalmarginalandaveragerevenue #elasticityofdemand #priceelasticity #perfectcompetition #perfectlycompetitivemarket #longrunequilibriumofmonopolyfirm #problemsofmonopoly #monopoliesdevelopment #monopolisticcompetition #oligopoly #examrace #examrace #upsc #ugcnet",

Therefore, the slope of the straight line is Aq1 /Oq1 = p\n\n\nAverage revenue (AR) of a firm is the total revenue per unit of output (for a price-taking firm, average revenue equals the market price) TR/q=p\nPrice line or Average Revenue is horizontal straight line (demand curve is perfectly elastic - firm can sell as many units of the good as it wants to sell at price p)\nMarginal revenue (MR) of a firm is the increase in total revenue for a unit increase in the firm’s output or ∆𝑅𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒/∆𝑄𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑦\nFor the perfectly competitive firm, 𝑀𝑅=𝐴𝑅=𝑝\nThis horizontal straight line is called the price line. It is also the firm’s AR curve under perfect competition\nTotal revenue from the sale of 2 boxes of candles is Rs.20. Total revenue from the sale of 3 boxes of candles is Rs.30. \nConsider the situation when the firm’s output changes from q1 to q2 . Given the market price p, MR = (pq2 –pq1 )/ (q2 –q1 ) = [p (q2 –q1 )]/ (q2 –q1 ) ]= p \nThus, for the perfectly competitive firm, MR=AR=p\nKey concept - When a firm increases its output by one unit, this extra unit is sold at the market price. Hence, the firm’s increase in total revenue from the one-unit output expansion – that is, MR – is precisely the market price.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 NCERT Class 12 Chapter 4 Economics: Theory of The Firm Under Perfect Competition\n0:23 Perfect Competition\n10:16 Profit Maximization\n21:211 Supply Curve of Firm\n25:37 Shut Down Point\n32:13 Market Supply Curve\n34:55 Price Elasticity of Supply\n#ncertclass12 #chapter4economics #theoryofthefirmunderperfectcompetition#perfectcompetition #profitmaximization #supplycurveoffirm #shutdownpoint #marketsupplycurve #priceelasticityofsupply #examrace #examrace #upsc #ugcnet",

They consist of gifts, remittances and grants. They could be given by the government or by private citizens living abroad.\nCurrent Account is in balance when receipts on current account are equal to the payments on the current account. A surplus current account means that the nation is a lender to other countries and a deficit current account means that the nation is a borrower from other countries\nBalance on Current Account has two components:\n• Balance of Trade or Trade Balance\n• Balance on Invisibles\nBalance of Trade (BOT) is the difference between the value of exports and value of imports of goods of a country in a given period of time. Export of goods is entered as a credit item in BOT, whereas import of goods is entered as a debit item in BOT. It is also known as Trade Balance.\nNet Invisibles is the difference between the value of exports and value of imports of invisibles of a country in a given period of time. Invisibles include services, transfers and flows of income that take place between\ndifferent countries. Services trade includes both factor and non-factor income. Factor income includes net international earnings on factors of production (like labour, land and capital). Non-factor income is net sale of service products like shipping, banking, tourism, software services, etc.\n\nCapital Account records all international transactions of assets. An asset is any one of the forms in which wealth can be held, for example: money, stocks, bonds, Government debt, etc. Purchase of assets is a debit item on the capital account. If an Indian buys a UK Car Company, it enters capital account transactions as a debit item (as foreign exchange is flowing out of India). On the other hand, sale of assets like sale of share of an Indian company to a Chinese customer is a credit item on the capital account. Classifies the items which are a part of capital account transactions. These items are Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs), Foreign Institutional Investments (FIIs), external borrowings and assistance.\nSurplus in capital account arises when capital inflows are greater than capital outflows, whereas deficit in capital account arises when capital inflows are lesser than capital outflows #examrace #upsc #ugcnet",

According to the theory, as long as there are no barriers to trade like tariffs (taxes on trade) and quotas (quantitative limits on imports), exchange rates should eventually adjust so that the same product costs the same whether measured in rupees in India, or dollars in the US, yen in Japan and so on, except for differences in transportation. Over the long run, therefore, exchange rates between any two national currencies adjust to reflect differences in the price levels in the two countries\nIf a shirt costs $8 in the US and Rs 400 in India, the rupee-dollar exchange rate should be Rs 50. To see why, at any rate higher than Rs 50, say Rs 60, it costs Rs 480 per shirt in the US but only Rs 400 in India. In that case,  all foreign customers would buy shirts from India. Similarly, any exchange rate below Rs 50 per dollar will send all the shirt business to the US. Next, we suppose that prices in India rise by 20 per cent while prices in the US rise by 50 per cent. Indian shirts would now cost Rs 480 per shirt while American shirts cost $12 per shirt. For these two prices to be equivalent, $12 must be worth Rs 480, or one dollar must be worth Rs 40. The dollar, therefore, has depreciated. #examrace #upsc #ugcnet",

Funnel shaped bays have more magnitude. \nTidal current: When tide is channeled between islands or bays\nHighest tide in world – Bay of Fundy, Canada with bulge of 15-16m\nThere are 2 high and 2 low tides every 24 hours\n\nRefer\nhttps://www.examrace.com/IAS/IAS-FlexiPrep-Program/Postal-Courses/Examrace-IAS-Geography-Series.htm\n\nAlso \nhttps://www.doorsteptutor.com/Exams/IAS/Mains/Optional/Geography/\n\n\nFor handouts google "NCERT Class 11 Geography Chapter 14 Examrace Youtube Handouts"\nMovement of Water @0:21\nVertical Movement @0:32\nHorizontal Movement @0:43\nWaves @1:05\nComponents of Waves @3:17\nTides @3:24\nTidal Surge @4:53\nTypes of Tides @6:00\nSpring Tide @6:26\nNeap Tide @6:50 \nOcean Currents @9:25\nSecondary Force @9:35\nPrimary Force @9:44\nStrongest Current @10:50\nThermohaline Circulation @11:48\nTypes of Ocean Currents @11:53\nMajor Ocean Currents @13:00\n#Diurnal #Semidiurnal #Gravitational #Components #Amplitude #Horizontal #Movement #Vertical #Gravity #Horizontal #Manishika #Examrace\nMovement of ocean water ppt\nMovement of ocean water class 11 notes\nMovements of ocean currents\nHorizontal movement of water is called\nMovement of large ocean waves\nTypes of water movement\nA movement of ocean water with a regular pattern is called\nHow many types of ocean movements are there which of them is useful to the fisherman #examrace #upsc #ugcnet',
